## 🔧 MINOR ISSUES TO RESOLVE

### Environment Variables Loading
**Issue**: Server not picking up SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
**Status**: Environment file exists, server restart needed
**Solution**: Restart development server or use runtime environment loading

### API Authorization
**Issue**: API routes returning "Unauthorized" 
**Cause**: Environment variables not loaded properly
**Impact**: Checkout form shows loading state instead of form fields

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE

### 1. Fix Environment Loading (5 minutes)
```bash
# Restart server with explicit environment variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321 \
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9... \
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9... \
npm run dev
```
