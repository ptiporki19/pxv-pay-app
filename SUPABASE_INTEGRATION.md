# Supabase Integration for PXV Pay

This document outlines the work done to integrate PXV Pay with Supabase, replacing all mock data with real database connections.

## What's Been Done

1. **Database Schema Setup**
   - Created comprehensive database schema in `supabase/migrations/01_initial_schema.sql`
   - Defined tables for users, merchants, payments, notifications, countries, currencies, payment methods
   - Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies for proper data access control
   - Set up PostgreSQL functions and triggers for automatic notifications and audit logging

2. **Real-time Functionality**
   - Configured all tables for Supabase's real-time subscriptions
   - Implemented automatic notifications when payment statuses change
   - Built real-time test panels in `/test-realtime` page

3. **Admin Pages Integration**
   - Updated the following admin pages to use real Supabase data:
     - Countries management
     - Currencies management
     - Payment methods management
     - User management
     - Audit logs
     - Dashboard statistics

4. **Checkout Flow Integration**
   - Updated the payment checkout flow to save directly to the database
   - Implemented proper authentication and authorization

5. **Testing and Setup Tools**
   - Created seed data for testing in `supabase/seed.sql`
   - Built database setup script in `scripts/setup-db.sh`
   - Created testing SQL queries in `scripts/test-supabase-integration.sql`

## What You Need to Do

To complete the integration, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Local Supabase**
   ```bash
   # Start Supabase locally
   supabase start

   # Apply database schema and seed data
   cd scripts
   chmod +x setup-db.sh
   ./setup-db.sh
   ```

2. **Verify Integration**
   - Run the application and check that all pages load data from Supabase
   - Test the payment flow to ensure it creates records in the database
   - Test real-time functionality in the `/test-realtime` page

3. **Additional Integration Points to Review**
   - Verify profile data updates on profile pages
   - Test merchant account creation and management
   - Test payment approval flows for merchants
   - Review notifications system
   - Test search functionality in admin pages

## Database Structure

Here's an overview of the key tables and their relationships:

- **profiles**: Extends auth.users with additional user information
- **merchants**: Stores merchant account data
- **payments**: Records all payment transactions
- **notifications**: Stores user notifications
- **countries**: Lookup table for supported countries
- **currencies**: Lookup table for supported currencies
- **payment_methods**: Configuration for supported payment methods
- **audit_logs**: Records system actions for auditing

## Real-time Features

The following tables have real-time updates enabled:
- profiles
- merchants
- payments
- notifications
- countries
- currencies
- payment_methods
- audit_logs

When a payment status changes, a notification is automatically created for the user through database triggers.

## Row Level Security (RLS)

We've implemented comprehensive RLS policies to ensure:
- Users can only access their own data
- Merchants can only see payments made to them
- Admins have broader access for management
- Everyone can read reference data (countries, currencies, payment methods)
- Only admins can modify reference data

## Next Steps

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Update your `.env.local` file with proper Supabase credentials
   - Ensure you have the correct Supabase URL and API keys

2. **Production Setup**
   - Apply the same migration scripts to your production Supabase instance
   - Create initial admin users through the Supabase dashboard
   - Set up proper backup and monitoring for your production database

3. **Enhanced Features**
   - Implement search functionality for admin pages using Supabase's text search
   - Add pagination for large data sets
   - Implement more sophisticated audit logging
