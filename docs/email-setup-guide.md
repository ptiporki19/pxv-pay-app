# Email Notification System Setup Guide

## 🎉 Status: Successfully Connected to Real Supabase!

Your email notification system is fully implemented and connected to your live Supabase project (`frdksqjaiuakkalebnzd`). The Edge Function is deployed and the system is ready for production use.

## ✅ What's Already Working

### 1. **Deployed Components**
- ✅ `send-email` Edge Function deployed to real Supabase

- ✅ Customer confirmation emails when payment proofs are uploaded
- ✅ Merchant notifications about new payments requiring verification
- ✅ Super admin notifications for payment activities and new user signups
- ✅ Welcome emails for new users
- ✅ Database types updated with real schema

### 2. **Email Notifications**
- **Customer Experience**: Confirmation emails with branded templates
- **Merchant Notifications**: New payment alerts with dashboard links
- **Admin Alerts**: User signup and payment activity notifications
- **System Integration**: Seamless integration with existing in-app notifications

## 🔧 Next Steps: Configure Email Provider

Currently, emails are being logged (development mode). To enable actual email sending, choose one of these options:

### Option A: SendGrid (Recommended)

1. **Get SendGrid API Key**:
   - Sign up at [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/)
   - Create an API key with "Mail Send" permissions

2. **Add Environment Variables** to your Supabase project:
   ```bash
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
   FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourcompany.com
   FROM_NAME=PXV Pay
   ```

3. **Set in Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Go to Settings → Edge Functions → Environment Variables
   - Add the variables above

### Option B: Custom SMTP

Add these environment variables instead:
```bash
SMTP_HOST=smtp.yourprovider.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_smtp_username
SMTP_PASS=your_smtp_password
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourcompany.com
FROM_NAME=PXV Pay
```

### Option C: Gmail SMTP (Development Only)
```bash
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_gmail@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your_app_password
FROM_EMAIL=your_gmail@gmail.com
FROM_NAME=PXV Pay
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

After configuring your email provider, test the system:

```bash
node scripts/test-email-system.js
```

You should see actual emails being sent instead of just logged.

## 📧 Email Templates

The system includes professionally branded email templates:

- **Payment Confirmation** (Customer)
- **New Payment Alert** (Merchant)
- **Admin Notifications** (Super Admin)
- **Welcome Email** (New Users)
- **Payment Status Updates**

All templates use your PXV Pay branding with responsive design.

## 🔒 Security & Best Practices

### Environment Variables
Always use environment variables for sensitive data:
- API keys
- SMTP credentials
- Email addresses

### Rate Limiting
The system includes built-in protections:
- Email sending limits
- Error handling and retries
- Graceful fallback to logging

### Privacy
- Customer email addresses are handled securely
- No sensitive payment data in email content
- Proper data retention policies

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### 1. Environment Variables
Set all required environment variables in your production Supabase project.

### 2. Domain Authentication
For SendGrid:
- Verify your sending domain
- Set up DKIM authentication
- Configure SPF records

### 3. Email Deliverability
- Use a professional from email address
- Monitor bounce rates
- Set up proper DNS records

## 📊 Monitoring

### Email Logs
Check Supabase Edge Function logs:
```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard
Go to Edge Functions → send-email → Logs
```

### Notification System
Monitor in-app notifications alongside email delivery in your dashboard.

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

The system is designed for easy extension:

- SMS notifications (Twilio integration)
- Email templates customization
- Advanced email analytics

### Phase 3 (Future)
