# Payment Method Form - Simplified Approach

## Overview

The new simplified payment method form addresses the user's requirements for a more intuitive, country-specific payment method configuration system. This approach eliminates confusion and provides a streamlined workflow for merchants.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Simplified Type Selection
- **Before**: Dropdown with multiple options (manual, payment-link, bank, mobile, crypto, etc.)
- **After**: Only two options - "Manual Payment" and "Payment Link"
- **Benefit**: Reduces complexity and focuses on the core payment types

### 2. Country-Specific Configuration
- **Before**: General settings that apply to all countries with unclear scope
- **After**: Configure each country individually with specific details
- **Benefit**: Clear understanding of what settings apply to which country

### 3. Dynamic Field Management
- **Manual Payment**: Add custom fields with labels and values (e.g., Account Number: 1234567890)
- **Payment Link**: Simple URL configuration
- **Benefit**: Flexible configuration that matches real-world payment requirements

## User Workflow

### Creating a Payment Method

1. **Basic Information**
   - Enter payment method name (e.g., "Bank Transfer")
   - Set status (Active/Inactive/Pending)
   - Add description
   - Set display order

2. **Country Configuration**
   - Select a country from dropdown
   - Choose payment type (Manual or Payment Link)
   - Configure country-specific details:
     - **For Manual**: Add payment fields (label + value pairs)
     - **For Payment Link**: Enter payment URL
   - Add country-specific instructions
   - Save country configuration

3. **Multiple Countries**
   - Repeat step 2 for each country
   - Each country appears as a configured item
   - Edit or remove countries as needed

4. **Final Submission**
   - Review all configured countries
   - Submit to create the payment method

### Example: Bank Transfer for Multiple Countries

**Payment Method Name**: Bank Transfer

**United States Configuration**:
- Type: Manual Payment

  - Account Number: 1234567890
  - Routing Number: 021000021

**Nigeria Configuration**:
- Type: Manual Payment  
- Fields:
  - Account Number: 0123456789
  - Bank Name: First Bank of Nigeria
  - Account Name: PXV Pay Ltd

**United Kingdom Configuration**:

## Technical Implementation

### Form Structure

```typescript
interface ConfiguredCountry {
  code: string
  name: string
  type: 'manual' | 'payment-link'
  fields: CustomField[]
  url?: string
  instructions?: string
}
```

### Data Flow

1. **Country Selection**: User selects from available countries

  "countries": ["US", "NG", "UK"],
  "country_specific_details": {
    "US": {
      "custom_fields": [...],
      "instructions": "...",
      "url": null
    },
    "NG": {
      "custom_fields": [...], 
      "instructions": "...",
      "url": null
    },
    "UK": {
      "custom_fields": [],
      "instructions": "...",
      "url": "https://stripe.com/pay/uk-payments"
    }
  }
}
```
