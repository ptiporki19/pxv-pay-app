# PXV Pay - Git Workflow & Deployment Guide

## 🌟 **Production-Ready Git Strategy**

This document outlines the Git workflow and deployment strategy for PXV Pay, ensuring production stability while maintaining efficient development cycles.

## 📋 **Branch Structure**

### **Main Branches**
- **`main`** - Production-ready code only
- **`development`** - Integration branch for new features
- **`feature/enhancements`** - Feature development branch
- **`hotfix/production`** - Urgent production fixes

### **Branch Protection Rules**
```
main (PROTECTED):
├── Only accepts PR merges
├── Requires code review
├── Must pass all tests
└── Auto-deploys to production

development:
├── Integration testing
├── Feature merging point
└── Staging environment

feature/*:
├── New feature development
├── Experimental changes
└── Individual developer work

hotfix/*:
├── Critical production fixes
├── Direct to main after review
└── Emergency deployments
```

## 🔄 **Development Workflow**

### **1. Starting New Feature**
```bash
# Switch to development branch
git checkout development
git pull origin development

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name
git push origin feature/new-feature-name
```

### **2. Working on Feature**
```bash
# Regular commits
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature functionality"
git push origin feature/new-feature-name
```

### **3. Feature Completion**
```bash
# Create Pull Request: feature/new-feature-name → development
# After code review and approval, merge to development
git checkout development
git pull origin development
```

### **4. Production Release**
```bash
# Create Pull Request: development → main
# After thorough testing and approval, merge to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

## 🚨 **Hotfix Workflow**

### **Critical Production Issues**
```bash
# Create hotfix from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue

# Fix the issue
git add .
git commit -m "hotfix: resolve critical production issue"
git push origin hotfix/critical-issue

# Create PR directly to main
# After review, merge to main
# Then merge main back to development
```

## 🛡️ **Production Safety Rules**

### **❌ Never Do This**
- Direct commits to `main` branch
- Push untested code to `main`
- Merge features directly to `main`
- Skip code review process

### **✅ Always Do This**
- Test features thoroughly in development
- Create Pull Requests for all changes
- Code review before merging to main
- Use descriptive commit messages

## 📦 **Deployment Strategy**

### **Development Environment**
```bash
# Deploy development branch to staging
git checkout development
npm run build
npm run deploy:staging
```

### **Production Environment**
```bash
# Deploy main branch to production
git checkout main
npm run build
npm run deploy:production
```

## 🔧 **Useful Git Commands**

### **Check Current Status**
```bash
git status
git branch -a
git log --oneline -10
```

### **Sync with Remote**
```bash
git fetch origin
git pull origin main
git push origin feature-branch
```

### **Clean Up Branches**
```bash
# Delete local branch
git branch -d feature/old-feature

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete feature/old-feature
```

## 🎯 **Commit Message Standards**

### **Format**
```
type(scope): description

feat: add new feature
fix: resolve bug issue
docs: update documentation
style: formatting changes
refactor: code restructuring
test: add tests
chore: maintenance tasks
```

### **Examples**
```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement OAuth login"
git commit -m "fix(payments): resolve checkout validation"
git commit -m "docs(api): update endpoint documentation"
```

## 🚀 **Deployment Checklist**

### **Before Production Deploy**
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Database migrations ready
- [ ] Backup created
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared

### **After Production Deploy**
- [ ] Verify application functionality
- [ ] Check error logs
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Validate user flows
- [ ] Update documentation

## 📊 **Monitoring & Rollback**

### **Health Checks**
```bash
# Application health
curl https://your-app.com/api/health

# Database connectivity
npm run db:check

# Service status
npm run status:check
```

### **Emergency Rollback**
```bash
# Revert to previous production version
git checkout main
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or deploy previous working commit
git checkout [previous-working-commit]
git checkout -b hotfix/rollback
git push origin hotfix/rollback
# Create PR to main
```

## 🔍 **Best Practices Summary**

### **Development**
1. **Feature Isolation**: Each feature in separate branch
2. **Small Commits**: Frequent, focused commits
3. **Descriptive Messages**: Clear commit descriptions
4. **Regular Sync**: Pull latest changes frequently

### **Testing**
1. **Local Testing**: Test before pushing
2. **Integration Testing**: Test in development branch
3. **Production Testing**: Final validation before deploy
4. **Regression Testing**: Ensure existing features work

### **Security**
1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit secrets
2. **Code Review**: All changes reviewed
3. **Branch Protection**: Protect main branch
4. **Access Control**: Limit production access

## 📞 **Emergency Contacts**

### **Production Issues**
- **Technical Lead**: [Your Contact]
- **DevOps Team**: [DevOps Contact]
- **Database Admin**: [DBA Contact]

### **Escalation Path**
1. Developer → Technical Lead
2. Technical Lead → DevOps Team
3. DevOps Team → Management
