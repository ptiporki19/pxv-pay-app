  - Enhanced payment method handling

### 4. Validation Schema Updates

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
cd pxv-pay
npm run dev
```
The app should be running on http://localhost:3006

### 2. Navigate to Payment Methods
- Go to http://localhost:3006/payment-methods
- Check that the page loads with tabs for different payment method types
- Verify the sidebar shows only one "Payment Methods" entry (not separate entries)

### 4. Test CRUD Operations
- Try creating a new payment method
- Test editing existing payment methods
- Test deleting payment methods
- Verify real-time updates in the UI

### 5. Test Tab Functionality
- Switch between different payment method type tabs
- Verify filtering works correctly
- Check that the tab interface is intuitive

## üîÆ Next Steps (if needed)

1. **Apply Database Migration**: 
   - Install Supabase CLI: `npm install -g supabase`
   - Run: `supabase db push`

2. **Add Test Data** (if tables are empty):
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   node add-test-data.js
   ```

3. **Fix RLS Policies** (if access issues persist):
