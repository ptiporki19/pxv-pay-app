## Overview

I've successfully created a dedicated Super Admin dashboard and blog management system for PXV Pay with the following features:

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

1. **Super Admin Central Dashboard** (`/super-admin`)
   - Prominent welcome message with role identification
   - Platform overview statistics (users, payments, etc.)
   - Quick access cards to key Super Admin areas
   - Professional black/white theme consistent with the app

2. **Blog Management System** (`/blog-management`)
   - Complete blog post management interface
   - Real-time Supabase integration
   - Table view with all blog posts
   - Statistics cards (Total, Published, Drafts)
   - Author information display
   - Publishing status management

3. **Enhanced Navigation**
   - Super Admin-specific navigation items
   - Role-based conditional rendering
   - Updated middleware for route protection

4. **Database Schema**
   - Complete `blog_posts` table with RLS policies
   - Proper relationships and indexes
   - Automatic timestamp management
   - Tag support for categorization

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create the Blog Posts Table

1. Open Supabase Studio at: http://127.0.0.1:54323
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the entire content from `manual-blog-migration.sql`
4. Run the script

This will create:
- `blog_posts` table with all necessary columns
- Proper RLS policies for security
- Indexes for performance
- Triggers for automatic timestamp updates
- A sample blog post

### Step 2: Verify Super Admin User

Ensure you have a super admin user in your database:

```sql
-- Check if super admin exists
SELECT * FROM public.users WHERE role = 'super_admin';

-- If needed, create or update a user to super admin
UPDATE public.users 
SET role = 'super_admin' 
WHERE email = 'your-admin-email@example.com';
```

### Step 3: Access the Super Admin Features

1. Sign in with your super admin account
2. Navigate to `/super-admin` for the central dashboard
3. Navigate to `/blog-management` for blog management
4. Use the sidebar navigation for quick access
