This document highlights how to implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) logic in code.

**User Roles:** Refer to the `role` column on the authenticated user object: 'super_admin', 'registered_user', 'subscriber', 'free_user'.

**Permission Enforcement Layers:**

1. **RLS (Database):** Primary data security (handled as per `supabase-data-rls.mdc`).
2. **Backend (API/Server Actions):** Always check user role before performing sensitive operations. Return errors for unauthorized access.
3. **Frontend (Conditional Rendering):** Hide/show UI elements (menu items, buttons, sections) based on user role for a better user experience. DO NOT rely on this for security.

**Specific Role Permissions Context (Refer also to RBAC Structure Canvas):**

- **Super Admin:** Full access. Can see/do everything.
- **Registered User (MVP):** Can access the merchant panel and configure *their own* instance (countries, currencies, methods, linking). Can use the checkout flow. Limited analytics view. Cannot manage users, blog, audit logs.
- **Subscriber (Post-MVP):** Full feature access (including advanced analytics, webhooks, unlimited links, etc.).
- **Free User (Post-MVP):** Very limited access. Primarily view-only on configuration sections. Restricted payment links (3/month). Cannot create/modify configurations, access advanced features, or see webhook logs.

**Implementation Directives for AI:**

- When building admin features, include checks to ensure the authenticated user has the necessary role (e.g., check `user.role === 'super_admin'` or `user.role === 'registered_user'` depending on the feature in MVP).
- When building public pages or checkout flow (user side), ensure they handle authenticated vs. unauthenticated users appropriately, but core payment *process* is generally accessible.
- For features with tiered access (mostly Post-MVP, but prepare for it), implement frontend conditional rendering based on roles.
- Ensure backend API endpoints for sensitive operations explicitly check the user's role obtained from the authenticated session
