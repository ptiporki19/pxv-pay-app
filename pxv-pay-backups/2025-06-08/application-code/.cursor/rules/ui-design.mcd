# PXV Pay UI, Shadcn, and Tailwind Guidelines

This document covers frontend UI development.

**UI Library:** Shadcn UI.
- Use Shadcn UI components as the default for common UI elements (buttons, forms, tables, dialogs, cards, etc.).
- Prefer composing Shadcn components over building custom ones from scratch unless necessary.

**Styling:** TailwindCSS.
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling whenever possible.
- Avoid writing custom CSS unless it's for global styles or overriding Shadcn/Tailwind where utilities are insufficient.
- Ensure responsiveness using Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.).

**Theming:**
- The application uses a theme defined by CSS variables (refer to global styles).
- Shadcn components and Tailwind classes should automatically use these variables.
- Ensure dark mode is supported and styles are correct when the `.dark` class is active.

**Responsiveness:**
- All pages and components must be responsive and look good on desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes.

**Key Directives for AI:**
- Generate UI code using Shadcn UI components.
- Apply styling using TailwindCSS utility classes.
- Ensure the generated UI is responsive.
- Assume the global theme variables are available and will style the components.
- When building forms, use Shadcn form components integrated with React Hook Form and Zod.
